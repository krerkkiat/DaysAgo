# DaysAgo

Enter the number of days (`N`) and you will get a date that is `N` in the past from today in the format off `MM/DD/YYYY`.

## Build

```
dotnet build
```

To publish a single binary file,

```
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

## Why

I just want a quick solution to find out the date a job application was posted. The job board I used only show me the number of days
the job has been posted.
